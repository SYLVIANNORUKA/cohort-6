#Task 3

# Tokenized Crowdfunding Platform  

This project implements a decentralized crowdfunding platform where contributors receive ERC20 tokens as rewards and top funders get ERC721 NFTs. The **ERC20 contract** (CrowdToken) mints tokens based on contribution amounts, while the **ERC721 contract** (CrowdNFT) mints NFTs for contributors exceeding a set threshold. The **crowdfunding smart contract** tracks contributions, distributes rewards, and allows the project owner to withdraw funds if the goal is met. All contracts are designed to interact seamlessly, ensuring transparency and efficiency in the funding process.
